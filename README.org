#+TITLE: max

=max= is a simple example of how to bootstrap [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] from a typical
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html][initialization file]] to an [[http://orgmode.org/][=org-mode=]] literate programming
initialization.

* Getting Started

  To try =max= without replacing an existing Emacs configuration, run
  the =emacs.sh= script.

  It does two things:

  1. Temporarily sets =HOME= to the full path to this directory.
  2. Runs Emacs.

  =1.= means that Emacs will implicitly load the =./.emacs.d/init.el=
  file included in this repository.  This file is responsible for
  loading the Emacs Lisp [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Working-With-Source-Code.html#Working-With-Source-Code][code blocks]] present in the =max.org= file in
  /this/ directory.

* Coolâ€¦ what?

  Emacs initialization files [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InitFile][can become very complex]].  [[http://orgmode.org/][=org-mode=]] is a
  fantastic Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Major-Modes.html][major mode]] that can help create, organize and
  maintain a custom Emacs configuration.

  If you are new to Emacs and/or [[http://orgmode.org/][=org-mode=]] this can be a difficult
  approach.  =max='s goal is to make creating and maintaining a
  literate programming Emacs configuration file as easy as it can be.
